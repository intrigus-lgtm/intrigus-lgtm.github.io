Thdis is the website of _Intrigus' Security Lab_.\
I want to share my knowledge about anything related to security like static analysis (especially {{ site.linkToCodeQlGithub}}), vulnerabilities I've found, fuzzing, and everything else.

When I'm not on my computer, I'm busy studying computer science and playing the piano.
