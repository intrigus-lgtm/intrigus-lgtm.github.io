Welcome to Intrigus' Security Lab (ISL).

This will mostly be about bugs I've found with or without {{ site.linkToCodeQlGithub}}. But also any other security related stuff.\
I decided to create the ISL so that I can keep everything securtiy related neatly in one place.
The goals of the ISL are twofold:
- I've already found too many bugs and got so many CVEs assigned that I want to write down my findings.
Both, because memory is always fading over time and also because it's harder than I expected to keep track of everything I've found.
- I hope that my notes on vulnerabilities and blog posts may be useful to others :)
